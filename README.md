# MiniCPM Modified Files

These modified files are an enhancement over the original [**MiniCPM**](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-o) project files. Compared to the original versions, these files add timestamps at many important parts of the code to clearly show the logic and flow of the process.
